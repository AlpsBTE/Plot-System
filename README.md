<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
The Plot System is an essential part of any BuildTheEarth server system,
meant to run alongside the classic Terra servers to make participating a lot easier
and appeal to both the casual and power users.
The Plot-System gives every player the opportunity to participate in the project with the latest Minecraft version.

After clicking on the Companion in the inventory, a menu appears in which you can select a city from the list.
If you now click on one of these cities,
you will be taken to a random plot in this city and can start building immediately.
Links to Google Maps, Google Earth & OpenStreetMap will appear when you enter the plot,
allowing you to quickly find your way around. 

The system is designed to make it easier for inexperienced people,
casual players and applicants to start building in BTE and to massively shorten application times. 

The plugin is mostly developed by the Alps-BTE team and is intended for everyone who wants to use and contribute to it.
If you have any questions regarding the setup or contribution, please do not hesitate to contact us.

All used Libraries and APIs are listed below.
# Features
## Plot Types
![FocusMode_PlotSystemBanner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64250550/184678178-f8b5c3e5-ec35-4b6b-9b1b-ac3170148d34.png)<font size="3">The focus mode is the old well-known mode that was also used by default before the release of v3.0. Build your plot on a floating island in an empty void world. Simple and straightforward, like in the good old days.
<br/><br/>‚ûñ No Environment
<br/>‚ûñ No Neighbouring Plots
</font><br/><br/>![InspirationMode_PlotSystemBanner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64250550/184681201-2f7e2103-df8d-42a3-93b0-ce42770e4fa8.png)<font size="3">The inspiration mode feels like building in a normal world. By adding the surrounding area of your plot, you will see neighbouring buildings, streets and vegetation. In comparison to the focus mode, you will have a better orientation which helps you when building. This mode is selected as default, when using the Plot System for the first time.
<br/><br/>‚ûï Environment
<br/>‚ûñ No Neighbouring Plots

Build with your friends and others in one world next to each other and see continuous progress.
<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è This mode is not fully stable and still in BETA

## Tutorials
The main goal of the tutorial system is to assist players who are new to the Build The Earth project. With the help of a **Get Started**
Tutorial, which needs to be completed to use the Plot-System and other features, new players will be guided through the casual Build The Earth
building process to understand how it works.
